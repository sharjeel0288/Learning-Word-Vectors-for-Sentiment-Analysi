# Learning-Word-Vectors-for-Sentiment-Analysi
Abstract
Unsupervised vector-based approaches to semantics can model rich lexical meanings, but
they largely fail to capture sentiment information that is central to many word meanings and
important for a wide range of NLP tasks. We
present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word
vectors capturing semantic termâ€“document information as well as rich sentiment content.
The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment information as well as non-sentiment annotations. We instantiate the model to utilize the
document-level sentiment polarity annotations
present in many online documents (e.g. star
ratings). We evaluate the model using small,
widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods for sentiment classification. We also introduce a large dataset
of movie reviews to serve as a more robust
benchmark for work in this area.
